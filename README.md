Boston Azure AI runs virtual community events for the global community and in-person events for the Boston community. Topics span AI, Azure, cybersecurity, and tools with the goal of helping those in developer, ops, and security roles be more productive and stay up-to-date in a rapidly evolving industry. The group started as Boston Azure in 2009 (the first of its kind) and after 15 years was renamed to Boston Azure AI. Founded in 2009 as Boston Azure (the first of its kind), the group evolved into Boston Azure AI after 15 years and now boasts over 3500 members in its free community.
